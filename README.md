# DataScience_MachineLearning_Projects
Following my learning path, these projects were done to practice knowledge about Data Science and Machine Learning.

### SONAR Rock vs Mine

This model can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. For this use case, we are using Logistic Regression Model for our prediction.

### Diabetes Prediction

This model can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. In this project, we use Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.
